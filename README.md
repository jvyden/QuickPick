# QuickPick
A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod that lets you quickly pick ProtoFlux nodes and components in desktop mode.

## Usage

There are two ways of invoking QuickPick. Firstly is by having a ProtoFlux Tool equipped, and by using the CTRL+G shortcut to spawn the ProtoFlux node browser.

Secondly is by holding the shift key while doing an action that opens the component browser, e.g. holding shift while clicking on 'Add Component' in an inspector, or while clicking 'Browse nodes' in your context menu.
